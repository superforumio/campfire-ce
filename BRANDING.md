# Branding Customization Guide

This guide explains how to fully customize Campfire-CE to match your brand identity. All branding can be configured through environment variables and asset files—no code changes required!

## Table of Contents

- [Visual Assets](#visual-assets)
- [Custom Styles](#custom-styles)
- [Advanced Customization](#advanced-customization)
- [Testing Your Branding](#testing-your-branding)

## Environment Variables

All textual branding is controlled through environment variables in your `.env` file.

### Application Identity

These variables define how your community is named and identified:

```bash
# The full name of your community
APP_NAME="My Awesome Community"

# Short name for mobile/PWA (keep under 12 characters)
APP_SHORT_NAME="MAC"

# Description shown in PWA manifest and meta tags
APP_DESCRIPTION="A welcoming community for creative entrepreneurs"

# Your primary domain (without https://)
APP_HOST="chat.yourdomain.com"
```

**Where these appear:**
- `APP_NAME`: Page titles, email subject lines, welcome messages, sign-in pages, PWA manifest
- `APP_SHORT_NAME`: Mobile home screen icon label
- `APP_DESCRIPTION`: PWA description, meta tags, app store descriptions
- `APP_HOST`: Email links, URL generation, CSP policies

### Contact & Support

Configure how your community communicates with members:

```bash
# Support email shown in error messages and help pages
SUPPORT_EMAIL="support@yourdomain.com"

# Name shown in "From" field of emails
MAILER_FROM_NAME="My Awesome Community"

# Email address shown in "From" field
MAILER_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

**Where these appear:**
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL`: Error messages, help contact buttons, footer
- `MAILER_FROM_NAME` & `MAILER_FROM_EMAIL`: All outgoing emails (sign-in codes, notifications, etc.)

### Visual Branding

Configure PWA theme colors via environment variables:

```bash
# Theme color for mobile browser address bar and PWA
THEME_COLOR="#1d4ed8"

# Background color for PWA splash screen
BACKGROUND_COLOR="#ffffff"
```

**Where these appear:**
- Theme Color: Mobile browser address bar, PWA theme
- Background Color: PWA splash screen background

**Note:** These colors are for Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality only—they control the mobile browser chrome and splash screens, not the actual app UI styling.

**Color recommendations:**
- Use your brand's primary color for Theme Color
- Use white (#ffffff) or your brand's background color for Background Color
- Ensure good contrast between the two

**Default values:** Theme Color: `#1d4ed8` (blue), Background Color: `#ffffff` (white)

### Analytics (Optional)

If you use Plausible Analytics:

```bash
# Your Plausible analytics domain
ANALYTICS_DOMAIN="yourdomain.com"
```

Leave empty to disable analytics tracking.

### Security

Configure Content Security Policy frame ancestors:

```bash
# Comma-separated list of allowed domains for iframe embedding
CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS="https://yourdomain.com, https://*.yourdomain.com"
```

**Default behavior:**
If not set, automatically uses your `APP_HOST` value.

## Visual Assets

Replace these image files with your own branding:

### Favicons & Icons

Located in `app/assets/images/icons/`:

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `favicon.ico` | 16x16 | Browser tab icon (ICO format) |
| `favicon-16x16.png` | 16x16 | Small browser icon |
| `favicon-32x32.png` | 32x32 | Standard browser icon |
| `apple-touch-icon.png` | 180x180 | iOS home screen icon |
| `android-chrome-192x192.png` | 192x192 | Android home screen icon |
| `android-chrome-512x512.png` | 512x512 | Android splash screen |

### Logo Files

Located in `app/assets/images/logos/`:

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `app-icon.png` | 512x512 | Primary app logo |
| `app-icon-192.png` | 192x192 | Smaller app logo variant |

### Default Icon

The `campfire-icon.png` in `app/assets/images/` is used as a fallback. Replace it with your brand's icon.

### Creating Your Icons

**Quick method using a single source image:**

1. Start with a high-resolution square logo (1024x1024px minimum)
2. Use an online tool like [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
3. Upload your logo and download the generated icon pack
4. Replace the files in the directories above

**Design tips:**
- Use simple, recognizable designs that work at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds
- Test how your icon looks at 16x16px
- For iOS, consider providing extra padding (safe area)

## Custom Styles

Administrators can add custom CSS directly through the admin interface:

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Go to `/accounts/edit`
3. Scroll to "Custom Styles"
4. Add your CSS

**Example custom styles:**

```css
/* Change primary button colors */
.btn-primary {
  background-color: #your-brand-color;
  border-color: #your-brand-color;
}

/* Customize header */
#header {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
}

/* Custom fonts */
body {
  font-family: 'Your Custom Font', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
}
```

**Note:** Custom styles are stored per account, not globally. Each community can have its own styles.

## Advanced Customization

### Logo Upload

Campfire-CE supports custom logo uploads through the admin panel:

1. Go to `/accounts/edit` as administrator
2. Upload your logo in the "Account Logo" section
3. The logo will automatically replace default branding

### Extending Branding Configuration

For developers who want to add more branding options, edit `config/initializers/branding.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # Add your custom branding values
  config.x.branding.custom_footer_text = ENV.fetch("CUSTOM_FOOTER_TEXT", "© 2024 Your Community")
  config.x.branding.twitter_handle = ENV.fetch("TWITTER_HANDLE", "@yourcommunity")
end

# Add delegations to the Branding module
module Branding
  class << self
    delegate :custom_footer_text, :twitter_handle, to: :config
    # ... existing delegations
  end
end
```

Then use throughout your views:

```erb
<%= Branding.custom_footer_text %>
<%= link_to "@#{Branding.twitter_handle}", "https://twitter.com/#{Branding.twitter_handle}" %>
```

### Translations & Internationalization

The app includes built-in translation support. To customize text:

1. Edit locale files in `config/locales/`
2. Add your translations for different languages
3. Community members can select their preferred language

## Testing Your Branding

### Local Testing

1. Set your environment variables in `.env`
2. Restart your Rails server: `bin/rails restart`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
4. Test these pages:
   - `/` - Home/marketing page
   - `/sign_in` - Sign in page
   - `/accounts/edit` - Settings (as admin)
   - Check email templates by triggering sign-in codes

### PWA Testing

To test Progressive Web App branding:

1. Deploy to a production server (PWA requires HTTPS)
2. Visit on mobile browser
3. Check "Add to Home Screen" functionality
4. Verify:
   - Home screen icon looks correct
   - App name displays correctly
   - Splash screen uses your branding
   - Theme color appears in mobile browser

### Email Testing

Test email branding:

```bash
# In Rails console
rails console

# Send a test auth token email
user = User.first
auth_token = user.auth_tokens.create!(expires_at: 15.minutes.from_now)
auth_token.deliver_later
```

Check that emails show:
- Correct "From" name and email
- Your app name in subject line
- Your app name in email body
- Correct support email address

### Browser Testing Checklist

- [ ] Favicon appears in browser tabs
- [ ] Page titles show your app name
- [ ] Error messages use your support email
- [ ] Sign-in page shows your branding
- [ ] Welcome message uses your app name
- [ ] Help/support buttons link to your support email
- [ ] Footer shows your app name
- [ ] PWA install shows correct name and icon

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Appearing

**Problem:** Updated environment variables but changes don't show

**Solution:**
```bash
# Development: Restart Rails server
bin/rails restart

# Production with Docker: Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Production with Kamal: Redeploy
kamal deploy
```

### Icons Not Updating

**Problem:** Replaced icon files but old icons still showing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache, or test in incognito mode
# For PWA: Uninstall the app and reinstall

# Force asset recompilation in production:
docker-compose exec app bin/rails assets:precompile
docker-compose restart
```

### Email "From" Name Not Changing

**Problem:** Emails still show old "From" name

**Solution:**

1. Check that `MAILER_FROM_NAME` and `MAILER_FROM_EMAIL` are set
2. Restart your application
3. Check `app/mailers/application_mailer.rb` is using `Branding`
4. For some email providers, you may need to verify the sender domain

### CSS Not Applying

**Problem:** Custom CSS in admin panel not showing

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you're logged in as administrator
2. CSS is account-specific; verify you're viewing the right account
3. Check browser console for CSS errors
4. CSS is loaded inline; it may be cached by the browser

## Examples

### Startup Community

```bash
APP_NAME="Startup Founders Club"
APP_SHORT_NAME="SFC"
APP_DESCRIPTION="A community for early-stage startup founders"
APP_HOST="chat.startupfounder.club"
SUPPORT_EMAIL="help@startupfounder.club"
THEME_COLOR="#10b981"  # Green
BACKGROUND_COLOR="#ffffff"
```

### Creative Community

```bash
APP_NAME="Creative Collective"
APP_SHORT_NAME="Creative"
APP_DESCRIPTION="Where artists and creators collaborate"
APP_HOST="community.creativecollective.io"
SUPPORT_EMAIL="support@creativecollective.io"
THEME_COLOR="#8b5cf6"  # Purple
BACKGROUND_COLOR="#faf5ff"  # Light purple
```

### Developer Community

```bash
APP_NAME="DevHub"
APP_SHORT_NAME="DevHub"
APP_DESCRIPTION="A community for developers to learn and grow"
APP_HOST="chat.devhub.community"
SUPPORT_EMAIL="hello@devhub.community"
THEME_COLOR="#0ea5e9"  # Blue
BACKGROUND_COLOR="#0f172a"  # Dark blue
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep APP_NAME concise** - It appears in many places; shorter is better
2. **Use consistent branding** - Match your website colors and fonts
3. **Test on mobile** - Most users will access via mobile
4. **Verify emails** - Test email delivery with your branding before launch
5. **Use high-quality icons** - Low-quality icons reflect poorly on your brand
6. **Document custom changes** - If you modify code, document it for future reference
7. **Test dark mode** - Ensure your branding works in dark mode if users enable it
