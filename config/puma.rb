# This configuration file will be evaluated by Puma. The top-level methods that
# are invoked here are part of Puma's configuration DSL. For more information
# about methods provided by the DSL, see https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html.
#
# Puma starts a configurable number of processes (workers) and each process
# serves each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
#
# You can control the number of workers using ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"]. You
# should only set this value when you want to run 2 or more workers. The
# default is already 1.
#
# The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# prioritize throughput over latency.
#
# As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# response time (latency) of the application.
#
# The default is set to 5 threads as it provides good throughput for Rails
# applications with I/O operations (database, ActionCable, HTTP requests).
#
# Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests; default is 3000.
port ENV.fetch("PORT", 3000)

# Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
# Workers are forked web server processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
# Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support processes).
#
# In production, we calculate workers as ~66% of CPU cores for optimal performance
# while leaving headroom for other processes (Redis, Solid Queue workers, etc.).
