# Campfire-CE (Community Edition)

A community-driven fork of [Small Bets](https://github.com/antiwork/smallbets) that makes it easy to run your own branded community. All branding (app name, logos, colors, emails) is configurable through environment variables—no code changes required.

Based on [Once Campfire](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire/), a Ruby on Rails chat application built by [37signals](https://once.com/campfire), with additional features from Small Bets. See [smallbets-mods.md](smallbets-mods.md) for a list of modifications.

This project combines the simplicity of Campfire with optional payment gating, passwordless authentication, and community features. Perfect for running paid memberships, course communities, or private group chats.

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [post an issue](https://github.com/ashwin47/campfire-ce/issues/new). Contributions welcome!

## Running in development

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4.5 (check with `ruby --version`)
- Redis server
- SQLite3
- Node.js with npm (or bun) for Tailwind CSS builds

### Customizing Branding

To run your own branded community, copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
APP_NAME="Your Community Name"
APP_HOST="chat.yourdomain.com"
SUPPORT_EMAIL="support@yourdomain.com"
MAILER_FROM_NAME="Your Community"
MAILER_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

See [BRANDING.md](BRANDING.md) for complete customization options.

### Setup

```bash
bin/setup
```

Start the app in development:

```bash
bin/dev
```

This starts both the Rails server and Vite dev server using Foreman (via Procfile.dev).

The `bin/setup` script installs Ruby gems and Node packages (via `npm install`), prepares the database, and configures the application.
If you skip `bin/setup`, install frontend dependencies manually with `npm install`.

All CSS is managed through Vite. Tailwind processes styles from `app/frontend/entrypoints/application.css`, which is automatically rebuilt during development.

## Running in production

Campfire-CE uses [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/installation/) for deployment. A modern tool that provides zero-downtime deployments with Docker.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Docker installed on the server
- A domain name pointing to your server
- Docker Hub account (or another container registry)
- Kamal CLI installed locally (install via `gem install kamal`)

### Initial Server Setup

1. **Initialize Kamal (creates `.kamal/secrets` if missing):**

   ```bash
   kamal init
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   Edit `.kamal/secrets` and add your production secrets, for example:

   ```bash
   # Registry
   KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=your-docker-hub-password
   REGISTRY_USERNAME=your-docker-hub-username

   # Server + domain
   SERVER_IP=your-server-ip
   PROXY_HOST=your-domain.com

   # Application secrets (generate with: rails secret)
   SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-rails-secret-key
   RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
   VIMEO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-vimeo-api-key
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapid-public-key
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-vapid-private-key
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
   COOKIE_DOMAIN=your-domain.com

   # Optional features
   GUMROAD_ON=false
   ```

3. **Initial deployment:**
   ```bash
   kamal setup    # Sets up Docker, builds image, starts services
   ```

### Subsequent Deployments

```bash
kamal deploy   # Zero-downtime deployment
```

### Automated Deployments

This repository includes GitHub Actions for automatic deployment:

1. **Set GitHub Secrets** in your repository settings:
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH key for server access
   - `SERVER_IP` - Your production server IP
   - `DOMAIN` - Your domain name (PROXY_HOST)
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME` & `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Docker Hub credentials
   - `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - Rails encryption key
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email delivery service
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - File storage
   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - AWS region (default: us-east-1)
   - `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` & `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` - Push notifications
   - `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook security
   - `COOKIE_DOMAIN` - Your domain for cookies
   - Optional: `GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `GUMROAD_ON`, `GUMROAD_PRODUCT_IDS`

2. **Deploy automatically:**
   - Push to `master` branch for automatic deployment
   - Or use "Deploy with Kamal" workflow for manual deployment

### Alternative: Manual Docker Deployment

If you prefer not to use Kamal, you can deploy manually with Docker:

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t campfire-ce .
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e RAILS_ENV=production \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-secret-key \
  -v /path/to/storage:/rails/storage \
  campfire-ce
```

### Database Backups

**IMPORTANT:** Campfire-CE does not include automatic database backups out of the box. You must implement your own backup strategy.

**Recommended Options:**

1. **Volume Snapshots** - Use your cloud provider's snapshot feature (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

2. **Periodic Backups** - Schedule cron jobs or scripts to backup the SQLite database:
   ```bash
   # Example: Daily backup at 2 AM
   0 2 * * * tar -czf /backups/campfire-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz /disk/campfire/db/production.sqlite3
   ```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#database-backups) for detailed backup strategies.
